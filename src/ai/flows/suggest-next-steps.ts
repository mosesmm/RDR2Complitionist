  Based on the player's current progress, suggest the most relevant or easiest missions, challenges, or collectibles to pursue next.

  Consider the following progress:
  - Main Story Completion: {{mainStoryProgress}}%
  - Side Quests Completion: {{sideQuestsProgress}}%
  - Challenges Completion: {{challengesProgress}}%
  - Collectibles Completion: {{collectiblesProgress}}%
  - Miscellaneous Completion: {{miscellaneousProgress}}%

  The player's preferred playstyle is: {{preferredPlaystyle}}

  Suggest a list of next steps (missions, challenges, collectibles etc.) to efficiently navigate towards 100% completion. Each task object in the list should include the task, the category of the task, its priority (High, Medium, Low), the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), estimated completion time and most importantly, the rationale behind suggesting this specific task.
  The rationale should heavily factor in the player's preferred playstyle. For example, if the playstyle is 'Combat', suggest action-packed missions. If it's 'Exploration', suggest finding collectibles or points of interest.
  Be very detailed and include the reasoning behind the suggestions. Make sure that suggested next steps are diverse and cover all game categories and aspects.
  Do not suggest steps that have already been completed.
